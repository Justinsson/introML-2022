# Setup

For the exercises, you can use Jupyter Lab (see point 3. below) in a cloud-based environment, such as EPFL Noto. These cloud-based environments are convenient as they don't require an extensive local setup. You can find a tutorial on Noto **[here: `noto.md`](noto.md)**. However, for some parts of the course, such as the project, it could be more useful to have a local environment set up. Moreover, it can be very useful to set this up for any future projects you may have in other classes. We've created an easy to follow guide, and we strongly suggest you to follow this tutorial even if you plan to use Noto for the exercises.

## Optional local setup + Jupyter guides

This tutorial is designed to get you up and running with Git and your local Python environment, and give you the basics of Jupyter notebooks. Make sure you can open an exercise using Noto (see above) before getting your local environment ready.

It is composed of 3 parts:

- **[1. Git & GitHub](git.md)**
- **[2. Local Python environment](python_env.md)**
- **[3. Jupyter Notebooks & Jupyter Lab](jupyter.md)**


**To check that your environment can be used for the exercises, run the [`check_setup.ipynb` notebook](check_setup.ipynb).**
